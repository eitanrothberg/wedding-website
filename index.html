      It wasn't long after first meeting in college that Eitan and Marili liked each other. Okay, <i>liked</i> liked. But still:
    </p>
    <p> 
      Eitan, marry a chatty Long Islander who's more interested in fashion than board games?
      And could Marili's true love really be a suburban Ohioan with a fierce vendetta against creamy salads?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes indeed! Through a pandemic, through a cross-country move, and
      through years of short-, medium-, and long-distance dating,
      their relationship has steadily been their greatest joy and adventure.

      Marili opened Eitan's eyes to the wonders of carne asada and folded laundry,
      and Eitan shared with Marili the magic of Cape Cod and Middle Earth.
      And together, they discovered some of their new favorite things, from
      tropical vacations and Saturday night pizza to road trips and farmers markets
      with live music.

      What does the future hold for these best of friends, these strange and happy lovebirds?

      beloved friends and family, and on just how sweet everything seems to taste.

  <div id="Jewish Weddings" class="tab-content">
    <h2>Traditional Jewish Weddings</h2>
    <p>We are thrilled you are here to help us mark this special moment in our
      lives. </br>According to Jewish tradition, a wedding is not just about two people
      finding happiness, it is a moment of celebration for all assembled.
    </p>
    <h3>Kippot</h3> 
    <p>  
      It is customary that Jewish males wear kippot (skullcaps) as a head
      covering. They represent our respect and humility in the presence of God,
      infinitely above our intellect and understanding. Non-Jewish males may
      choose to wear a kippah during the ceremony as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Kabalat Panim</h3> 
    <p>   
      Before the marriage ceremony begins, guests are invited into the kabbalat panim,
      the initial receptions held for the groom and bride. Men will join Eitan at his tisch
      - the groomâ€™s reception - and women will remain with Marili at the bridal reception.
    </p>
    <h3>Ketubah</h3> 
    <p>   
      At the tisch, the ketubah (marriage contract) will be formally signed by two witnesses.
      This tradition, at least two thousand years old, establishes the couple's obligations
      to each other and their commitment to establish a Jewish home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the signing, Eitanâ€™s mother and Mariliâ€™s mother will break a plate together,
      representing the importance of Eitan and Mariliâ€™s commitment to one
      another. Friends and family will then dance Eitan out of the room and towards the
      bridal reception for the bedeken.
    </p>
    <h3>Bedeken</h3>
    <p>
      The bedeken is a moment of great excitement as it is the first time in a week that
      Eitan and Marili will see each other. Eitan will place a veil over Mariliâ€™s face out
      of respect for her modesty and inner beauty. Then everyone will make their way to the
      chuppah for the official marriage ceremony.
    </p>
    <h3>Chuppah</h3>
    <p>
      The marriage ceremony takes place under a chuppah (wedding canopy), whose open walls
      symbolize unconditional hospitality and the home that Eitan and Marili will build
      together. As a fragile and temporary structure, the chuppah reminds us of the
      impermanence of life and that the most important thing about a home is not its
      physical construction, but the people in and around it.
    </p>
    <h3>Hakafot</h3>
    <p>
      When Marili arrives at the chuppah, she will circle Eitan seven times, an allusion
      to the seven days of creation and the new world they will build together.
    </p>
    <h3>Sheva Brachot</h3>
    <p>
      Hakafot are followed by the heart of the Jewish wedding ceremony: the sheva brachot,
      the seven blessings celebrating Godâ€™s role as the creator of all. These blessings,
      bestowed by dear friends and family, evoke images of humanity, parenthood, friendship
      and love â€“ at last focusing on the bride and groom themselves. The final blessing
      offers ten synonyms for the word joy.
    </p>
    <h3>Breaking the Glass</h3>
    <p>   
      Eitan will break a glass. The shattered glass symbolizes the fragility of relationships,
      of happiness, and of human life itself. It also reminds us that suffering continues to exist.
      Just as we began the ceremony by invoking Godâ€™s act of creation,
      we end by acknowleding our role in making that world whole. 
      </br>
      Amidst music, singing, and shouts of Mazel Tov, the party begins.
